# Euler-projects-1-Multiples-of-3-or-5
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

<b>About The Project</b>

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. https://projecteuler.net/

This is the first problem in the series. The challenge was to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. 

<b>Built with:</b>

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

for and while loops, conditional if and else if statements

<b>What I learned:</b>

I presented two solutions to the challenge. 

I learnt that there are more than one way to solve a problem.

The second solution ran 3 times faster than the first. The first solution required 1000 iterations while the second required about 533 iterations so I am inferring the less the number loops the faster the code will be.

I am learning how to write efficient code that uses less computing power.
